The project is a complete management based software.The purpose of Transportation Reservation system is to automate the existing 
manual system by the help of computerized equipmentâ€™s and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that
their data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. It can assist the workers
to concentrate on their activities rather than to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus, it will help the user in better utilization 
of its files. The system can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means one need not be distracted by information
that is not relevant, while being able to reach the information. Basically, the project describes how to manage for good performance and better 
services for the customers.Stored procedures are used to categorize transport details based on the name and booking them. The project introduces

scale business people without costing scanners and a very fast processing and provides facilities like storing transport names,details and ticket 
information details, the run days, number of passengers and ticket price details.
